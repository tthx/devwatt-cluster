    <value>hdfs://master:9000/home/yarn/tez/tez-0.9.2.tar.gz</value>
    <description>String value to a file path. The location of the Tez libraries which will be localized for DAGs. This follows the following semantics

    1. To use a single .tar.gz or .tgz file (generated by the tez build), the full path to this file (including filename) should be specified. The internal structure of the uncompressed tgz will be retained under $CWD/tezlib.
    2. If a single file is specified without the above mentioned extensions - it will be treated as a regular file. This means it will not be uncompressed during runtime.
    3. If multiple entries exist
        - Files: will be treated as regular files (not uncompressed during runtime)
        - Directories: all files under the directory (non-recursive) will be made available (but not uncompressed during runtime).
        - All files / contents of directories are flattened into a single directory - $CWD
