  <!-- Standalone Metastore -->
  <!-- Currently the following features have not been tested or are known not to work with the Metastore in standalone mode:
    - The compactor (for use with ACID tables) cannot be run without Hive.  ACID tables can be read and written to, but they cannot compacted.
    - Replication has not been tested outside of Hive. -->
